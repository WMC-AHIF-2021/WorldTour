# **Project Description**

### Static Part:

We are putting our focus on the cultures, recipes, sights and the population of each destination. With detailed research, we want to give travel enthusiasts and entrepreneurs a new opportunity to display all the most important information about each country at once.

### Dynamic Part:

In order to select a country you have to klick on a continent on the 3D-globe to get a zoomed-in and more detailed version. When the user has chosen the <u>desired destination</u>, a <u>simulated airplane</u> makes its way to it. From there on, it shows the user <u>all the information</u> about the country.
In the second semester, we want to use the online data resource and provide a request formular for data from the site: [Our World Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)

<br/>

## **Milestones**

1. <u>Research on recipes, cultures, sights</u> and <u>population</u> of each country until Halloween (31.10.2022).

2. <u>Create</u> a <u>logo, the website</u> and <u>3D-globe with all destinations</u> until the semester break (27.02.2022).

3. <u>Display all countries on</u> the <u>3D-world</u> and <u>be able to click on them</u> until the end of the year.

4. <u>Insert information</u> to each country and <u>simulate air plane</u> by end of submission.

5. <u>Presentation</u> on the agreed date.

## **Environmental Analysis and Risks**

### Audience Group:
* <u>Travel enthusiasts</u> can use our website to find out about new destinations and their most important conditions. 
* Likewise, <u>entrepreneurs</u> who want to work internationally and learn about cultures, can use our website as well.

### Technologies:
* We want to use the most famous web technologies like: <u>HTTP, HTML, CSS</u> and <u>Java Script</u> for our project.

### Potential Risks:
* <u>For project members:</u> Risks that could have an impact on our project are, that we may <u>take on too much</u> and <u>not be able to insert all the features</u> into our project.
* <u>For the environment:</u> When the finished website is in use, users may <u>travel more</u> with airplanes to different continents, which is <u>not good</u> for the <u>environment</u>.
