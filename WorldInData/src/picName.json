On August 12, 1985, a Boeing 747SR operating this route suffered a sudden decompression 12 minutes into the flight, and crashed in the area of Mount Takamagahara, Ueno, Gunma Prefecture, 100 km (62 mi; 54 nmi) from Tokyo 32 minutes later. The crash site was on Osutaka Ridge, near Mount Osutaka.\nJapan's Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission (AAIC) concluded,: 129  agreeing with investigators from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, that the rapid decompression was caused by a faulty repair by Boeing technicians after a tailstrike incident during a landing at Osaka Airport in 1978 as JAL Flight 115. The rear bulkhead of the plane had been repaired with an improperly installed doubler plate, compromising the plane's airworthiness. Cabin pressurization continued to expand and contract the improperly repaired bulkhead until the day of the accident, when the faulty repair failed, causing a rapid decompression that ripped off a large portion of the tail and caused the loss of hydraulic controls to the entire plane.\nThe aircraft, which was configured with increased economy-class seating, was carrying 524 people. Casualties of the crash included all 15 crew members and 505 of the 509 passengers. Some of the passengers survived the initial crash but died of their injuries hours later while awaiting rescue. Surpassing the fatalities of All Nippon Airways Flight 58 which crashed 14 years earlier with 162 fatalities, it is the deadliest single-aircraft accident both in Japan and global aviation history.\n"

A hurricane warning extended across the entire west coast of the peninsula on the morning of August 13.  But many people only paid attention to the center forecast line inside the track forecast error cone. That morning, the line was over the Tampa Bay region. But early that afternoon, Charley strengthened to a category 4 hurricane and veered a bit to the right, coming ashore at Punta Gorda, about 100 miles south of Tampa. \nHurricane Frances\nSeveral weeks later on September 5, Hurricane Frances made landfall as a category 2 at Hutchinson Island on the Florida east coast. The center of the storm was very large, 55 to 80 miles wide at landfall, but as the calm center passed overhead it belied what was to come as Frances moved inland. As the storm cut across the peninsula and moved on to the panhandle it created numerous tornadoes statewide.\nHurricane Ivan\nOn the same day that Frances hit, Hurricane Ivan developed over the tropical Atlantic Ocean. On September 16, Ivan center came ashore as a category 3 just west of Gulf Shores, Alabama. Portions of the Interstate 10 bridge system across Pensacola Bay were severely damaged due to the severe wave action on top of the 10-15 foot storm surge. Storm surge occurred all the way to Tampa Bay, about 500 miles from Ivan’s point of landfall. \nHurricane Jeanne\nFlorida’s east coast was still cleaning up from Frances when it was hit again on September 26, this time by Hurricane Jeanne as a category 3 storm. Its 55-mile-wide eye crossed the Florida coast at virtually the same spot where Frances did.

    "description":"The European debt crisis, often also referred to as the eurozone crisis or the European sovereign debt crisis, is a multi-year debt crisis that has been taking place in the European Union (EU) since the end of 2009. Several eurozone member states (Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus) were unable to repay or refinance their government debt or to bail out over-indebted banks under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties like other eurozone countries, the European Central Bank (ECB), or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nThe eurozone crisis was caused by a balance-of-payments crisis, which is a sudden stop of foreign capital into countries that had substantial deficits and were dependent on foreign lending. The crisis was worsened by the inability of states to resort to devaluation (reductions in the value of the national currency). Debt accumulation in some eurozone members was in part due to macroeconomic differences among eurozone member states prior to the adoption of the euro. The European Central Bank adopted an interest rate that incentivized investors in Northern eurozone members to lend to the South, whereas the South was incentivized to borrow because interest rates were very low. Over time, this led to the accumulation of deficits in the South, primarily by private economic actors. A lack of fiscal policy coordination among eurozone member states contributed to imbalanced capital flows in the eurozone, while a lack of financial regulatory centralization or harmonization among eurozone states, coupled with a lack of credible commitments to provide bailouts to banks, incentivized risky financial transactions by banks. The detailed causes of the crisis varied from country to country. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt as a result of banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.\n"

    "description":"By the early 2070s, plastic recycling is ubiquitous globally. Although some of the most rural and isolated areas still lack the required infrastructure and facilities, they now represent a negligible percentage.\nBelgian chemist Leo Baekeland invented the world's first synthetic plastic, Bakelite, in 1907. Improvements in chemical technology led to an explosion of new types of plastic, with mainstream adoption beginning in the 1940s and 50s. Production expanded at a phenomenal rate during the second half of the 20th century – from two million tons annually in 1950, to more than 200 million tons each year by 2000. With no end in sight to this upward trajectory and in light of concerns over its slow decomposition after disposal, as well as its toxicity, recycling emerged as a solution from the 1980s onwards. This was more environmentally friendly than incineration, or waste-to-energy methods, which had also begun some years before.\nHowever, even with both recycling and waste-to-energy systems in place, handling the mountains of plastic waste generated each year was proving to be a formidable challenge. Researchers noted the appearance of a \"Great Pacific garbage patch\", a gyre of marine debris in the north central Pacific Ocean estimated to contain over 1.8 trillion plastic fragments. By the early 21st century, this was having a substantial impact on seabirds, fish and other life in the food chain with implications for human health too. In 2019, plastic even appeared at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, during a deep ocean expedition. Scientists calculated that plastic waste could exceed fish biomass by 2050, unless major international efforts reversed this trend.\n"

    "description":"To guarantee the highest value from robotics investments, businesses must effectively converge business-critical IoRT and other IoT endpoints into a holistic and secure supply chain management ecosystem.\nWarehouses are a critical link in the supply chain, one that can either grind things to a halt or provide an invaluable boost. Robotics help facilities worldwide keep the supply chain moving at top-notch speeds by improving warehouse operating efficiency.\nThere is no shortage of warehouse robots, from autonomous mobile robots (AMR), rack-climbing pick-and-put-away robots, to cobots.\nInterestingly, the supply chain has seen significant growth in collaborative robots, or cobots, over recent years. They improve efficiency and productivity by augmenting the skills of human employees rather than attempting to replace them. Cobots can automate certain tasks in a warehouse, such as locating and picking items. They are also helping to track inventory levels, assist employees, move heavy objects, pack boxes and take care of a slew of other operational tasks.\nThis allows warehouses to achieve greater productivity without hiring a wave of new employees, which is extremely difficult given the “Great Resignation” sweeping the U.S.\nTechnology creates better supply chains by improving resilience, resource management and manufacturing processes. An efficient system starts with embracing technological change and using all the cutting-edge solutions available. Many of these technologies perform tasks more effectively, help reduce injuries and improve safety in the workplace. This will ultimately build a better and more sustainable supply chain for everyone, from manufacturing plant employees to consumers to investors and even the environment.\n"

    "description":"2100 is a year with 365 days. The year begins and ends on a Friday. It will be the 1st year of the zero years ('zero' for short) and will end the 21st century as a secular year.\nHuman intelligence is being vastly amplified by AI\nUbiquitous, large-scale automation has led to vast swathes of human employees being replaced by virtual or robotic counterparts. Strong AI now occupies almost every level of business, government, the military, manufacturing and service sectors.\nRather than being separate entities, these AIs are often merged with human minds, greatly extending the latter's capability. For instance, knowledge and skills can now be downloaded and stored directly within the brain. As well as basic information and data, this includes many physical abilities. A person can learn self-defence, for example, become an expert in any sport, or be taught to operate a new vehicle, all within a matter of seconds.\nThe world has been transformed by this fusion of people and machines. The vastly greater power of AI means that it has become, simultaneously, both master and servant to the human race.\nThe benefits of this human-AI merger require the extensive use of implants, however – something which a significant segment of the population still refuses to accept. Compared to transhumans, these non-upgraded humans are becoming like cavemen – thousands of years behind in intellectual development.* Unable to comprehend the latest technology, the world around them appears \"fast\" and \"strange\" from their increasingly limited perspective.* This is creating a major division in society.\n"
